## 🏗️ **NEW DEPLOYMENT ARCHITECTURE**

### **Current Enhanced Flow:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Code Push to main] --> B[Smart Change Detection]
    B --> C{Changes Detected?}
    C -->|No App Changes| D[Skip Deployment ⏭️]
    C -->|App Changes Found| E[Enhanced Deployment 🚀]
    E --> F[Pre-deployment Health Check]
    F --> G[Create Backup]
    G --> H[Deploy with Retry Logic]
    H --> I[Comprehensive Health Verification]
    I --> J{Health Check Pass?}
    J -->|✅ Pass| K[Deployment Success 🎉]
    J -->|❌ Fail| L[Automatic Rollback 🔄]
    
    D --> M[Smart Summary Report]
    K --> N[Success Summary Report]
    L --> O[Failure Summary Report]
```

### **Smart Change Detection Logic:**
```yaml
# DEPLOY when:
✅ app/, config/, database/, routes/ changes
✅ composer.json, package.json changes  
✅ Docker-related files changes
✅ First deployment or version endpoint unavailable
✅ Manual force deployment

# SKIP when:
⏭️ Only README.md, docs/, *.md changes
⏭️ Same SHA already deployed
⏭️ Only .gitignore, LICENSE changes
```
