/**
 * Main Web Routes Configuration
 * 
 * This file serves as the central routing hub for the Hanaya Shop e-commerce application.
 * It orchestrates the inclusion of specialized route files and defines global application routes.
 * The modular approach separates concerns between user, admin, and authentication routes.
 * 
 * Route Organization:
 * - User routes: Customer-facing functionality (products, cart, orders)
 * - Admin routes: Administrative panel and management features
 * - Auth routes: Authentication and authorization functionality
 * - Global routes: Application-wide features like chatbot
 * 
 * Architecture Benefits:
 * - Separation of concerns for maintainability
 * - Clear responsibility boundaries
 * - Easier debugging and development
 * - Scalable route organization
